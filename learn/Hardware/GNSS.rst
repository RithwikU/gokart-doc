GNSS
=========================

Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is the system used for obtaining the current position. We use the Sepntrio `Mosaic-H dev kit <https://shop.septentrio.com/en/shop/mosaic-h-gnss-heading-module-development-kit-2-gnss-antennae?utm_medium=website&utm_source=GNSS%20receivers%20or%20modules%20%20Page%20mosaic-H%20-%20CTA%20to%20webshop>`_
The dual antenna setup improves functionality as we also obtain heading (`True North heading <https://airplaneacademy.com/whats-the-difference-between-true-and-magnetic-heading-explained/#:~:text=True%20heading%20is%20your%20direction,being%20hundreds%20of%20miles%20apart.>`_) from the system.
