Ouster OS1 Lidar
================================

The backbone of our perception system is the Ouster Lidar which helps us use 3d Computer Vision techniques to perceive our environment (eg detect cones to determine the edge of the track).

More information on the Ouster is available here: `Ouster Website <https://ouster.com/products/scanning-lidar/os1-sensor/>`_.

The Ouster we used for our purpose was the 32 layer lidar OS1 version.

The drivers for lidar can be found here: `Driver Repo<https://github.com/ros-drivers/ros2_ouster_drivers>`_
