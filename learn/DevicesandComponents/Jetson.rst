NVIDIA Jetson AGX
==========================

We used the AGX for all our GPU computing. Just like any other NVIDIA Graphic Card, the Jetson has CUDA capabilities and is able to run Deep Learning models extremely fast. We mainly used it to run our cone detection algorithm.

More information about the Jetson AGX can be found here: `NVIDIA Jetson Website<https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-agx-xavier/>`_

The developer kit and addition resources for using the AGX can be found here: `Dev Kit and Resources<https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-xavier-developer-kit#resources>`_
