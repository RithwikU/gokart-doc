Follow The Gap
======================

Follow The Gap Algorithm is a reactive racing algorithm that races based on the obstacles in the environment and tries to avoid collisions by following the largest possible gap given.
This algorithm is very simple to implement and requires far less tuning than other racing algorithm like Pure Pursuit. Also this algorithm is a reactive-vision based algorithm and hence can work in GPS-denied situations to navigate the car.
